title: Start
location: dream
day: 1

You float formless in the space between.
It is quiet, comfortable, and vast beyond even your comprehension.
But also empty. You are alone. You have been alone for a very long time.
You drift as you always have, for what might be eons or an instant.
Then, you find yourself looking at a glowing speck of something, floating in that eternal void. It feels familiar.
You reach out to touch it.
Then, suddenly, light. It is blinding.
The nothingness that had surrounded you becomes everything all at once and then--
Stella[Dream]: Hey.
Stella[Dream]: It's going to be alright.
Stella[Dream]: You're not going to be alone anymore.
Stella[Dream]: It's so, so hard to keep living, but I'd like it if you tried to once more. If both of us tried.
Stella[Dream]: So, let's go.
Stella[Dream]: Together.
